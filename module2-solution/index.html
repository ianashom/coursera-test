      <p>
        Traveling is more than my hobby, it's my lifestyle, my joy, my love. I love exploring our Planet, nature, people, cultures. I visited more than 40 countries for now and I would love to share my experience with You and show that it's doable.

      I was working in several countries, it was a great experience, where I got lots of new skills, the most important of which is understanding people's culture better. I would like to share my experience with You and show that it's doable.

    <h2>Live Abroad</h2>
     <p>
       I was living in several countries and may be one day I will stop in one country and it will probably be not my homeland Russia. I already feel that my home is not Russia but the whole Planet. I would like to share my experience with You and discuss this topic.
